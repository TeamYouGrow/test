			<h1>About Us<h1>
			<p>We started with a research question, which was 'Can we assist residents of urban areas to optimize gardening for users in a way that it saves precious resources'.</p> 
			<p>From this, we created a problem statement, which was to design a watering system that would automatically help houselholds save resources and take care of their plants using technology.</p>
			<p>Our main objective is to optimize the user's experience growing plants using our technology. </p>
